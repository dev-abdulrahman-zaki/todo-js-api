using of displayStats is better than displayStats2.
because displayStats is already included in getTodos(). and it will update the stats when any changes happens.
and i don't need another .then chain to just displayStats at the mount of website!! and then replicate displayStats again in getTodos().
So It is better to include it in getTodos() from the beginning to handle both mount and update.
